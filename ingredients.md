A classic mojito is made from five ingredients: white rum, sugar, lime juice, mint leaves and club soda. And the mojito recipe I’m sharing with you today includes all of those items.

But instead of granulated sugar (or simple syrup) we’re swapping honey – and using half of the amount traditionally used. So I guess you could consider this more of a skinny mojito cocktail recipe.

I also highly recommend you use fresh limes and not packaged lime juice. In a cocktail recipe with few ingredients, the quality of the ingredients really matters. And you’ll definitely notice a more vibrant flavor with fresh limes.
