To make the best mojito…

Add 10-12 fresh mint leaves to a highball or collins glass. A glass in the 12 ounce to 14 ounce range is perfect. Add a teaspoon of honey and the juice from one lime (which equals two tablespoons of fresh lime juice).

Use a muddler to gently press on the mint leaves to help release their natural oils and aroma. A big mistake is over-muddling and breaking apart the mint leaves. Don’t do that as it creates mint shrapnel in your cocktail, which invariably gets caught in your teeth and releases the more bitter compounds from the mint leaves. A soft and gentle muddle is all that’s needed.

Add 2 ounces of white rum, which is the larger end of a cocktail jigger and use a cocktail spoon to stir everything together and make sure the honey is fully dissolved in the lime juice and rum.

Fill the glass with ice cubes until it’s nearly full, then top it off with club soda. Add a fresh sprig of mint, pop in a straw and enjoy the best mojito recipe.
